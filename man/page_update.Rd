\usage{
page_update(client_id, secret, page_id, body)
}
\arguments{
\item{client_id}{A client_id that can be created on the \url{developer.domo.com} page.}

\item{secret}{A secret that can be created on the \url{developer.domo.com} page.}

\item{page_id}{The ID of the page.}

\item{body}{An R \code{list()} that contains the specified definitions of the new page such as:
\itemize{
  \item \strong{name:} The name of the page.
  \item \strong{parentId:} If provided, the page will be created as a subpage to the page provided.
  \item \strong{locked:} will restrict other users the ability to make edits to page or its content - the default value is false.
  \item \strong{cardIds:} IDs provided will add or remove cards that are not a part of a page collection.
  \item \strong{visibility:} Determines the access given to both individual users or groups within Domo by providing these 2 parameters:
  \itemize{
    \item \strong{userIds:} The IDs of users that will be given access to view the page.
    \item \strong{groupIds:} The IDs of groups that will be given access to view the page.}}}
}
\description{
Updates the specified page by providing values to parameters passed. Any parameter left out of the request will cause the specific pageâ€™s attribute to remain unchanged.
Also, collections cannot be added or removed via this endpoint, only reordered. Giving access to a user or group will also cause that user or group to have access to the parent page (if the page is a subpage). Moving a page by updating the parentId will also cause everyone with access to the page to have access to the new parent page.
